n ***********************\n

Dear (Name of Boss),

I am writing to express my sincere apology for my recent behavior. I understand that my actions or words have not been appropriate for the workplace environment, and I regret any inappropriate behavior that I may have caused.

As you know, I am a strong proponent of artificial intelligence (AI). I believe that AI has the potential to positively transform the way that businesses work, and provide value over traditional methods. I understand that I should have remained professional at all times, and kept my enthusiasm and excitement regarding AI in check.

Please accept my apology. I understand that I must remain professional at all times, and act in accordance with company policy. I assure you that this will not happen again.

Once again, I apologize for my behavior and I understand that my lapse in judgement was unacceptable.

Sincerely,

(Your Name)
