# Program to print a star pyramid using artificial intelligence. 

# define the max width of the pyramid    
height = 6

# Loop for each row in the pyramid    
for row in range(1, height+1): 
          
    # number of spaces 
    k = height - row  

    # Loop for printing the required number of stars in each row 
    for j in range(0, k+1): 
        print(" " , end="") 
          
    # inner loop for printing stars in each row  
    for col in range(1, (row*2)): 
        # Printing stars 
        if col%2==0: 
            print("*", end="") 
        else: 
            # Printing spaces 
            print(" ", end="")  
      
    # ending line after each row 
    print("\r")
