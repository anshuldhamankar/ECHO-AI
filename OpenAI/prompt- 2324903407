Dear Boss,

I want to begin by apologizing for my actions and the way I have handled the situation. I understand that my actions and behavior have not been in line with company values, and I'm sorry for the disappointment and frustration I have caused.

I understand the importance of adhering to company policies and regulations, and I realize that my behavior was unacceptable. I take responsibility for my mistakes, and I am committed to learning from them.

I will take the necessary steps to ensure that something like this never happens again. I'm sorry that I did not demonstrate the kind of attitude and values that our company expects of its employees.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
