Subject: Apology for Holiday

Dear Boss,

I'm writing to apologize for recently taking a holiday without getting your approval first. I realize that this put extra work onto other members of the team, and I'm sincerely sorry for any disruption that this may have caused.

At the same time, I want to take this moment to thank you and the team for your continuing support of my growth as an Artificial Intelligence researcher. I have been gaining invaluable experience in this field, and I am very thankful to be part of this team.

Once again, I apologize for any trouble that I caused, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to this team as a valuable member.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
