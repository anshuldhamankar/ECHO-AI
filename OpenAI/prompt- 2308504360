Dear [Boss],

It is with a heavy heart I must submit my resignation from my current position as [Position] at [Company]. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to pursue my focus on Artificial Intelligence, and the opportunities this sector has to offer.

The ability to work with you and the rest of the team have been a pleasure and will be sorely missed. Through my time here, I have gained valuable skills and a sense of camaraderie that I will take with me on my professional journey. Thank you for the guidance and mentorship you provided me throughout my employment.

I am deeply grateful for the opportunity you have provided me to grow and develop professionally and develop both my engineering skills and creative capabilities.

I am available to discuss the transition process for the next few days before my official last day with the team. I look forward to staying in touch, and I wish the best for the company in the future.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
