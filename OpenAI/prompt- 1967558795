Open AI response fromwrite a mail to Boss for apologizing him using artificial intelligence
n ***********************\n

Dear Boss,

I am writing to apologize for my careless mistake in handling the Artificial Intelligence project. I understand and regret the fallout of my actions and the time and money wasted due to my mistake.

I understand that you have put in a lot of effort, time and money into this big project, and my actions have compromised its success. I know that I should never have allowed my lack of attentiveness to put our work in such a compromising position.

I understand that my mistake was grave and inexcusable and I regret deeply that I have put our work at so much risk. I want to assure you that I have learnt from my mistake and in the future, I will take much more caution and be more careful. 

Once again, I apologize for my mistake and would like to assure you that it will never happen again. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
